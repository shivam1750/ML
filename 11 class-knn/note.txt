Step 1: Collect and Preprocess the Data

Collect the dataset you want to use for training and testing the KNN model.
Preprocess the data by:
Handling missing values (e.g., imputation, deletion, or mean/median/mode substitution)
Normalizing/scaling the data (e.g., min-max scaling, standardization)
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding)
Step 2: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Split the preprocessed data into two sets:
Training set (e.g., 70% of the data): used to train the KNN model
Testing set (e.g., 30% of the data): used to evaluate the performance of the trained model
Step 3: Choose the Value of K (Number of Nearest Neighbors)

Determine the value of K, which is the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions.
Common values of K are 3, 5, 7, or 11, but you can experiment with different values to find the best one for your specific problem.
Step 4: Calculate the Distance Metric

Choose a distance metric to measure the similarity between data points. Common distance metrics include:
Euclidean distance
Manhattan distance
Minkowski distance
Cosine similarity
Calculate the distance between each data point in the training set and the test data point.
Step 5: Find the K-Nearest Neighbors

Sort the distances calculated in Step 4 in ascending order.
Select the K nearest neighbors (based on the distance metric and value of K) for each test data point.
Step 6: Make Predictions

For each test data point, calculate the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors' labels.
Assign the predicted label to the test data point.
Step 7: Evaluate the Model

Use the testing set to evaluate the performance of the trained KNN model.
Common evaluation metrics include:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Tune the hyperparameters (e.g., K, distance metric) to improve the model's performance.
Step 8: Deploy the Model

Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
You can use the KNN model as a standalone model or as part of a larger machine learning pipeline.
